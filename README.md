##Opened up NotePad to edit

I have now written some things on here

I did it by opening Notepad

Why not?

I did try to find out how to write with GitBash 

I know you can (As I have by accident when committing message)

* But it's done now
* It's a verison control doc not a text editor
* And I have Notepad as text editor

So I'm moving on now

adding this to the repo now
